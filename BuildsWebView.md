For WebView to work in this app....




eas build --platform android --clear-cache

...rather than...

eas build --platform android --profile development







eas build --platform ios --clear-cache  <---I think!!! I'll have to test it soon!!!


...rather than...


eas build --platform ios --profile development




EXPLANATION:
The difference between eas build --platform android --clear-cache and eas build --platform android --profile development lies in how they handle caching.

When you use --clear-cache, it clears any stored build artifacts and forces a completely fresh build, which can resolve issues like outdated or improperly linked native modules (such as react-native-webview).

On the other hand, --profile development just uses the development configuration without clearing the cache, so if there were lingering issues in the cache, they might persist.

Clearing the cache ensures you're starting from a clean slate.
